LOX
Native Javascript, no dependencies

##  Part-1
Part-1 of the tutorial at https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-1/ sets up the screen, draws to it, builds a basic game loop, and handles input.

### Completed Prior
Screen setup and basic drawing were done in [Part-0](https://mootootwo.github.io/lox/part-0).  This was necessary to validate that the imported font was rendering correctly, and was done as part of the dependency setup.

Instead of `Hello World` we have a simple test pattern that validates our font size and canvas configuration.

Some basic serialized loading functions were setup during this part to allow the screen drawing to being after the font finishes loading.
