    How I want to update shading

    identify each perimiter tile
    plot slope back to origin
    follow each slope from origin out, stoping when obstacle hit

        from POV
        for each octant
        perimiter y = pov-dy; until pov; y++
        perimiter x = pov; until distance>max¦¦ x===y; x++
            for each perimiter tile
                measure slop to POV
                from pov, find each tile along slope
                stop when non-transparent tile hit
    
    OR

    from origin
    draw each octant
    when obstacle hit, plot path back to origin
    while drawing rest of octant, check against list of shadow slopes
    stop processing rows when distance reached?

        from pov
        for each octant
            y = pov; until max; y++
            x = pov; until x=y ¦¦ until distance>max; x++
            if obstacle, check slope back to pov
            check each new tile against array of slopes

    ^^ this second method is better.  keep array of slopes for each obstacle,
    dont do a ray-cast for every tile on the perimiter
    will have much less overlap of tiles near the pov
    will track many fewer slopes
