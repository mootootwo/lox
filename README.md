r/roguelikedev Roguelike Tutorial 2022

This is part of the annual code-along tutorial based on https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-0/

The tutorial is written for Python 3, but this project adapts it to JavaScript.  No external libraries will be used.

I am not a software developer and I have no idea what I am doing.
