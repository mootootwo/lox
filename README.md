This is part of the annual code-along tutorial based on (https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-0/)

The tutorial is written for Python 3, but this project adapts it to JavaScript.  No external libraries will be used.

I am not a software developer and I have no idea what I am doing.
