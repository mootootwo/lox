r/roguelikedev Roguelike Tutorial 2022

This is part of the annual code-along based on this [tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/)

The tutorial is written for Python 3 and the TCOD library, but this project adapts it to native JavaScript.  No external libraries will be used.

I am not a software developer and I have no idea what I am doing.
