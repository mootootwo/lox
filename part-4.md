Part-3 of the [tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-4/) .  Filed of View.

### NOT DONE
- entites should be visible or invisible
- entities should be lit or not lit
- tiles should be explored or not explored
- tutorial treats tiles and entities separatly.  I could unify this, but I sill render the map separatly from other entities

- tutorial tracks visible and explored in unique arrays
- i dont love this, not sure if I will do it.  we'll see when we get there.

- tutorial stores lit and unlit characters/colours.  I may not do this, may use an alpha layer on top or may colour shift unlit characters

- will need to add a colour function to be able to tweak RGBA values
