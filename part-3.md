##  Part-3
Part-3 of the [tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-3/) .Generating a dungeion

### Divergence
I'm going to start diverging a bit from the tutorial at this point.  Instead of carving out hollow rooms from an otherwise solid map, I'm turning it a bit inside out and making some interconnected solid rectangles on an otherwise hollow map.  

For referefreence, these are the topics the tutorial walks through.  I'll be working on similar analogues to each:
 
- Rooms
- Slices
- Tunnels
- generate_dungeon returns GameMap
- line of sight library
- yield / generator
- check for intersection
- keep running list of rooms
- min/max room size


### Generator
list of rooms
mix/max number of rooms
min/max size of rooms
intersection testing
connections?  

#### Rectangular module

#### Next thing..
