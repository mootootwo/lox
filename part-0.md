# r/roguelikedev Roguelike Tutorial 2022
LOX
Native Javascript, no third party libraries

##  Part-0
Part-0 of the [tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-0/) sets up the development environment and downloads dependencies.

### Language
Javascript, currently V8 10.1.124.12 

### Editor
Vistual Studio Code - Insiders.  I needed to use the Insiders edition specifically to overcome some compatibility issues on Win7.

### Runtime Enviornment
Chrome 101.0.4951.67 at the time of this commit.  Likely to change several times over the course of this project.

For a local sandbox I am hosting via an IIS server on Win7, because it is distributed with my OS and I have easy access to it.  Any lightweight web server will do if you are working on a similar project.
